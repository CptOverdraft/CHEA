# CHEA – The Meme Token That Never Launched 🐶

This repository documents a meme token experiment built around my French bulldog, Chea.

Inspired by BobCat (PSPS) and their shelter support efforts,  
CHEA was intended to be a community-driven, purpose-first project —  
with real utility, social meaning, and a sprinkle of chaos.

It never launched. But we built everything anyway.

  - 1% Fee
  - 1% Burn
  - 1% Liquidity
  - 1% Charity
- Secret website-based airdrop system (with hidden clues!)

## 👨‍🚀 Who Built It?

Just two of us:
- 🧠 Human (me): Vision, structure, stubborn optimism
- 🤖 AI (ChatGPT): Smart contract design, security ideas, endless patience
