# CHEA – The Meme Token That Never Launched 🐶💤

This project documents the early attempt at building a meaningful meme token around my real French Bulldog, Chea.

Inspired by BobCat (PSPS) and their animal shelter efforts, CHEA aimed to combine blockchain, community-driven charity, and storytelling into a single token. It never launched — but we wrote and built everything anyway.

## 🚧 Why It Never Launched

It grew too fast too soon.  
The scope was ambitious for a two-member team — just me and my AI sidekick, ChatGPT.

CHEA taught us more than any successful launch ever could.

## 💡 What Was Planned

- Smart contract in Rust (Solana)
- Max transaction & burn limits: 1%
- Fee breakdown:
  - 1% Burn  
  - 1% Liquidity  
  - 1% Charity  
  - 1% Treasury
- MultiSig admin (2/3 confirmation)
- Secret airdrop system triggered by website-based easter eggs

## 👨‍🚀 Who Built This?

- 🧠 Human (me): Vision, strategy, trial & error
- 🤖 AI (ChatGPT): Smart contract logic, architecture, infinite patience
